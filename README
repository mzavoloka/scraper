This script scrapes google. It eats filename of the file with a list of queries.
Example usage:
perl scraper.pl queries

It's not really finished yet. It contains serious bugs. I published it just to meet "the deadline".
I'll fix it later, at the moment I just want to go sleep.

Test js task is here, too.
